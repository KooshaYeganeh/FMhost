## Overview
This project is part of an initiative to **prevent electronic waste** by repurposing old servers and computers. By converting your old devices into functional video hosting servers, you can contribute to sustainability while creating a useful tool for your personal or organizational video storage needs.

The application serves as a simple **video hosting server**, where users can store and stream videos from old hardware. The server is built using **Flask** (a lightweight Python web framework), and it hosts videos stored in a specific directory on your Linux machine.

## Features
- Serve videos from any folder on your Linux machine.
- Web interface to list videos and stream them in a browser.
- Responsive design using **Bootstrap 5**.
- Modal video player for smooth viewing experience.
- Open source and free to use.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with **Flask**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with **Bootstrap 5**
- **Operating System**: **Linux** (e.g., Ubuntu)
- **Video Hosting**: Serve videos from your own file system

## Project Structure

    /app.py
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-hosting-server.git
cd video-hosting-server
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3** and **pip** installed on your system. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 3. Run the Flask App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can now access your video hosting server through your browser.

### 4. Customize Video Directory

Modify the `VIDEO_FOLDER` variable in `app.py` to point to your desired directory where the videos are stored. For example:
```python
VIDEO_FOLDER = "/home/{username}/Videos/Hosting"
```

Replace `{username}` with your actual Linux username.
